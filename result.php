    <h1>Your Result: 63</h1>
    <h3>INTERPRETING THE BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY</h3>
    <p>Now that you have completed the questionnaire, add up the score for each
        of the twenty-one questions by counting the number to the right of each
        question you marked. The highest possible total for the whole test would
        be sixty-three. This would mean you circled number three on all twenty-one
        questions. Since the lowest possible score for each question is zero, the
        lowest possible score for the test would be zero. This would mean you
        circles zero on each question.
        
        You can evaluate your depression according to the Table below. 
    </p>
